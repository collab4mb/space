laundry:
  use less hardcoded values in build.h
  add ui utility functions to make it easier to maintain build.h
  remove stupid tag system from the UI
  make it easier to variate between font sizes in UI

semi-fun:
  make sure that it's not possible to place pillars at very high proximity
  add more animations to build mode
  make pause menu, it will show some options on the left

fun:
  save/load functionality
  electricity sources
  integrate everyhing everyone did and push onto master

later:
  renderer should be extracted from main, main is currently very big
