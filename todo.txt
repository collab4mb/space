semi-fun:
  make sure that it's not possible to place pillars at very high proximity
  add more animations to build mode

fun:
  # Semi-implemented, current implementation is a stub as it doesn't work well across machines
  save/load functionality 
  electricity sources

later:
  renderer should be extracted from main, main is currently very big
  relationships between ents
